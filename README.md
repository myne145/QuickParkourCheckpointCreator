# Quick Parkour Checkpoint creator

A Paper plugin, that helps with setting up Parkour course checkpoints, with holograms above them.
It works by executing a couple of commands at once:
- ***/pa create checkpoint <course_name>*** <br>to create a checkpoint on desired parkour course
- ***/dh create ... %parkour_current_checkpoint_hologram_<course_name>_<checkpoint_number>%*** <br>to create a hologram above the checkpoint, with its number (using Parkour's built-in support for PlaceholderAPI)
# Requirements
